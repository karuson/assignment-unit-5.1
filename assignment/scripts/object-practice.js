// Add the required code to complete the tasks below

/* 1. Create an object literal to represent you!
  - Give the object a 'firstName & (separate) 'lastName' property
  - Give it a boolean 'hasSiblings' property
  - Give it  a numeric 'shoeCount' property
  - Also give it an array 'favThreeFoods'

// test boolean property - should be truthy?

lastName: 'Lynch',

shoeCount: 7,
favThreeFoods: ['Steak', 'Ice Cream', 'Peanut Butter']
  // TODO - add properties here
}; // end me

// make sure the <me> object looks okay in the console
console.log('A little about me:', me);

/* 2. Accessing object properties.
  - Create a variable called fullName 
  - Use the firstName & lastName properties of the object you 
    created above to set its value. 
  - Console.log fullName
*/

// object properties accessed with <object>.<property>
const fullName = `${me.firstName} ${me.lastName}`;

// check to make sure <fullName> appears correctly
// space in between <first> & <last>???

/* 3. Nested arrays
  - Console.log your first favorite food
  - Console.log your last favorite food 
*/

// Log the favThreeFoods array to check work
// Log what the correct answer should be then call first & last index
console.log(me.favThreeFoods);
console.log(`Our first favorite food should be Steak: ${me.favThreeFoods[0]}`);
console.log(`Our last favorite food should be Peanut Butter: ${me.favThreeFoods[2]}`);

/* 4. Change a property of an existing object.
  - Console.log your current shoe count.
  - Guess what?! You just got a new pair of shoes!!!
  - Set your object's shoeCount to be what it was plus 1
  - Console.log your updated shoe count. 
*/

// practice string concatenation in console logs, check spacings
console.log(`The shoe count is: ${me.shoeCount}`);
me.shoeCount++;
// Updated shoeCount should be incremented by 1
console.log(`The updated shoe count is: ${me.shoeCount}`);

/* 5. Add a new property to an existing object.
  - Add a 'favoriteColor' to your existing object
  - Do this the same way you updated the variable above
  - Cool huh? It works, even though it wasn't there before
  - Console.log your object
*/

// Don't judge me ðŸ™‚
me.favoriteColor = 'Champagne Gold';
console.log(`My favorite color is: ${me.favoriteColor}`);
